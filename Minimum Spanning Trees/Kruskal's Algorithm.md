# <u>Kruskal's Algorithm</u>
### <u>Definition</u>
Kruskal's algorithm is a greedy minimum spanning tree algorithm finds the subset of the edges of the graph which:
* form a tree including every vertex
* has the minimum sum of weights among all the trees taht can be formed from the graph

Kruskal's treats the graph as a ***forest*** (undirected acyclic graph; two vertices connected by at most one path). A tree connects to another *iff* it has the **least cost**.
	**ðŸ’¡:** Scans all edges by **increasing weight**; if an edge is safe add it to *F*
## <u>Pseudocode</u>
```javascript
function kruskal(V,E):
	sort E by increasing weight
	forest = âˆ…
	for each vertext v âˆˆ V do:
		MakeSet(v)
		for each edge (u,v) âˆˆ E do:
			if Find(u) != Find(v)
				add (u,v) to forest
				Union(u,v)
	return forest
```
### <u>Algorithm Description</u>
##### <u>Union-Find</u>
Kruskal's algorithm maintains a partition of vertices of G into disjoint subsets (the components of our forest), using a data structure that supports the following operations:
* *MakeSet(v)* â€” Create a set containing only the vertex *v*
* *Find(v)* â€” Return an identifier unique to the set containing v
* *Union(u, v)* â€” Replace the sets containing u and v with their union. (This operation decreases the number of sets).
##### <u>Steps</u>
1. First thing we do in this algorithm is **sort the set of edges *E*** by weight in increasing order. Costs **O(E log V)**
	* *(This will be important in our second for loop)
2. We then **initialize an empty forest** that we'll be filling with our discovered nodes.
3. Iterate through the sorted edge list. Because we sorted our edge list in increasing order, **any edge we examine is safe**.
	* For example, if we found a non-safe edge between two components then there must be a lighter edge with exactly one endpoint in A. 
		 *BUT, this is impossible* because inductively every previously examined edge has both endpoints in the same component of the forest.
4.  We check if two vertices belong to the same cluster **(this decides whether adding an edge creates a cycle)**. 
5. If they don't create a cycle we create a union between them.

### <u>Time Complexity</u>
The worst case time complexity of this algorithm is **O(E log V)**.
